# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
For this project we are analyzing data on various fundraisers. Instead of searching through all the campaigns we are going to pinpoint the ones that are most like the one that Louise is going to kickstart. We will provide visual analysis with the data that we think will be most helpful to Louise.

### Purpose
Our purpose is to provide Louise suggestions that will help her decide when to launch her campaign and what her goals should be.
## Analysis and Challenges
From our analysis we can tell that campaigns that were launched in May did the best from the theater category. Some of the issues we ran into were how to clean the data to help tell the story and how to pinpoint the exact data to help out Louise for her kickstarter.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From this chart we can tell that campaigns that ran in may were the most successful. We will advise Louise to start her campaign around this time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

If we look at the chart we notice that alot of the projects that failed had to high of a goal, making the data irrelevant. Louise's best option is to make a realistic goal that is obtainable to have a successful fundraiser.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges that are ensued by choosing our data is deciding whether or not we are looking at all of the correct categories. From the data we were given it was not enough to ensure that Louise will have a successful fundraiser or not. There are many other factors that will go into Louise having a successful kickstarter campaign but we did the best with the data that we have.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Based on the launch date we can assume that starting the campaign in May is most likely the best time. We can also assume that starting the campaign in the month of December is something Louise should defintely not do.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After creating a line chart for an outcome based on goals we can safely say that most campaigns that have goals higher than 50,000 are not realistic and usually turn out to be failed campaigns, Louise should stick to a realistic goal to have the most successful goal possible.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations of this dataset are that we do not have precise locations for where the fundraisers take place. If we had a better idea of where the kickstarters occured we might be able to better understand why certain kickstarters were successful or unsuccessful. For example some theater fundraisers might be in more populated locations making a higher goal more obtainable or certain fundraisers that had a higher goal actually had a reason to do so because they could've been in more highly populated areas.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are so many tables that you can make with the data we were given, the first thing i would do is ask Louise what her play is about to see if we can relate it to different parent categories, coutries etc. I would do an outcome based chart and add places & restaurants to it since these are both options that people have to go outside of their houses to visit and donate assuming there isn't much advertising online for them.
